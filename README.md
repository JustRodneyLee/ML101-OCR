>A simple Neural Network that recognizes English Letters
This is a simple program written to recognize the 26 English Letters. Using the Neural Network model, the program can be run to train itself to identify different English letters.

# How it works
For those who are not familiar with machine learning technology, the neural network model is the most popular learning model in the A.I. industry.
Basically, a neural network is a web of interconnected neurons, each holding a bias value, and numerous weights depending on how many other neurons are connected to it. The neurons form layers, which then interconnect to form a fully functional neural network. There are basically three parts in a neural network, an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer. 

# Demo Result
Below is the result of a successful attempt to recognize the letter 'A'. The image is drawn in MS Paint.
